          <p> We organized our “Hour of Code” event with the students of Sumgayit city <br>
            secondary school number 4 on the 10th of December. The major purpose of this <br>
            event is to teach them how algorithms work and why we use them. </p>

            Firstly, Abdullah talked about our event in detail and <br>
            provided children with the information about code.org. Then <br>
            Elnare talked about ADA University, especially SITE faculty, children<br>
            were listening to her carefully, then asked questions about ADA exams, <br>
            study-life. Then Leyla introduced a presentation with examples of our <br>
            daily life activities in order to help students to perceive the steps of <br>
            the algorithm. This presentation consists of an introduction of the<br>
             algorithm and types of algorithm.

          <p>
            After this introduction, we continued with code.org steps. <br>
            There were 20 steps in total, each of us was explaining 5 of them.<br>
             Some of the children’s intelligence surprised us. Even when we were <br>
             explaining the steps, some of them finished them on their own. <br>
             We showed Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and so many people’s motivational<br>
             videos that are related to the future of coding. In the end, Togrul were <br>
             working with students to solve harder stuff and suggested to them more <br>
             courses to improve their skills in code.org.<br>
             What did the children gain? <br><br>
1.	They learned in more detail the essence of intelligence.<br>
2.	We were working altogether, they need to think fast, as a result, it made them more vigilant. <br>
3.	It was a motivation for children to think about programming.<br>
4.	It was a pleasure for them because they asked that will they have a chance to get a lesson again from us.<br><br>
What did we gain?<br>
1.	We recognized our team-member better.
