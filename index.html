            became very interesting for us. At first I was worried that we <br>
            would start without any idea about creating a web-site, but after <br>
            solving the stages in the code-academy, the site became an entertaining <br>
            part for us. It was very convenient for us to work together as a group <br>
            because we could easily help each other and share our ideas. I think <br>
            it was a positive effect for us to gather at the Mars academy with my <br>
            teammates and share our thoughts live."
